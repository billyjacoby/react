# Website Meeting Finder 2.0

With only a [Meeting Guide format JSON file](https://github.com/code4recovery/spec) or a Google Sheet, web servants can have the same meeting finder found in the [12 Step Meeting List](https://github.com/code4recovery/12-step-meeting-list) WordPress plugin on any website platform.

[Here's a demo](https://react.meetingguide.org/) of what the meeting finder looks like with no styling, and [here's a demo](https://react.meetingguide.org/demo.html) of what it can look like embedded in a random website design.

Advantanges:

- faster performance for users
- reduced strain on servers
- can be used on any web platform
- can be embedded in any layout
- wider pool of potential project contributors (not just WordPress webmasters)
- simplifies WordPress plugin (separation of concerns)

## Installation

You don't need to download anything. Simply add the following code to your page:

1.  In your `<head>` add:

        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://react.meetingguide.org/style.css">

1) In your `<body>` add:
   <meetings src="/path/to/meetings.json"/>
   <script src="https://react.meetingguide.org/app.js" async></script>

1) Edit `/path/to/meetings.json` in the code above to point to your JSON file.

## Google Sheet Support

To use a Google Sheet as your backend:

1. Publish a Google Sheet that looks like [this example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQJ5OsDCKSDEvWvqM_Z6tmXe4N-VYEnEAfvU5PX5QXZjHVbnrX-aeiyhWnZp0wpWtOmWjO4L5GJtfFu/pubhtml).
1. Use this [blog post](https://coderwall.com/p/duapqq/use-a-google-spreadsheet-as-your-json-backend) to determine what the JSON URL of your sheet is.
1. Use that JSON URL as the `src` for your `meetings` tag.

## Maps

To add a free map to your site:

1.  Sign up for [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) (takes one minute and doesn't require a credit card)
1.  Copy your Public Access Token
1.  Use it in a `mapbox` parameter on your `meetings` tag, eg

        <meetings src="/path/to/meetings.json" mapbox="pk.aaaaabbbbbcccccdddddeeeeefffffgggg"/>

If you're using a Google Sheet, you will have to add `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns for your meetings to show up. There are [some tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+sheet+geocode) that can help.

## Advanced Customization

See [src/settings.jsx](settings.jsx) for options that can be set by defining a `window.config` object. You can customize many of the behaviors and all of the text strings that the app uses. Only include the values you wish to override.

### Change the column heading “Region” to “City”

    window.config = {
      strings: {
        en: {
          region: 'City',
        },
      },
    };

### Change “Newcomer” meeting type to “Beginner”

    window.config = {
      strings: {
        en: {
          types: {
            BE: 'Beginner',
          },
        },
      },
    };

A full list of meeting types can be found on the [Meeting Guide format spec page](https://github.com/code4recovery/spec). These can be overridden by specifying the code and preferred nomenclature as demonstrated above.

## To Do
